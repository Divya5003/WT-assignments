        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Practical Skills:</strong> SDP courses provide students with hands-on experience in the entire
            software development
            lifecycle. Students learn coding, project management, version control, testing, and debugging. This
            practical knowledge makes them job-ready and valuable assets in the software industry.
          </li>
          <br>
          <li>
            <strong>Problem-Solving:</strong> Working on real-world software projects challenges students to identify
            problems, design
            solutions, and implement them effectively. This fosters critical thinking and problem-solving skills
            applicable across various disciplines.
          </li>
          <br>
          <li>
            <strong>Teamwork and Communication:</strong> Developing software is often a collaborative effort. SDP
            courses emphasize
            teamwork, communication, and conflict resolution as students collaborate on projects. These skills are
            essential for success in any professional setting.

        <h3>Engineering Design & Innovation (EDI)</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Creativity and Innovation:</strong> EDI courses focus on fostering creativity and
            innovation in aspiring engineers. Students learn design thinking methodologies, user-centered design
            principles, and prototyping techniques. This equips them to develop innovative solutions to real-world
            engineering challenges.
          </li>
          <br>
          <li>
            <strong>Technical Expertise:</strong> EDI programs often delve into specific engineering
            tools and software used in design and analysis. Students gain proficiency in these tools, further enhancing
            their problem-solving capabilities and technical skillset.
          </li>
          <br>
          <li>
            <strong>Adaptability and Future-Proofing:</strong> The engineering landscape is
            constantly evolving. EDI programs help students develop adaptability and a problem-solving mindset. They
            learn to approach challenges with critical thinking and embrace new technologies.

        <h3>Design Thinking (DT)</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Empathy and User-Centricity:</strong> DT trains students to approach problems from
            the user's perspective. They learn to empathize with users, understand their needs, and design solutions
            that address them effectively. This user-centric approach is valuable for any field, not just design.
          </li>
          <br>
          <li>
            <strong>Creative Problem-solving:</strong> DT methodologies emphasize iterative
            problem-solving. Students learn to brainstorm ideas, prototype solutions, test them with users, and iterate
            based on feedback. This fosters a creative and adaptable approach to tackling complex challenges.
          </li>
          <br>
          <li>
            <strong>Communication and Collaboration:</strong> Effective communication and
            collaboration are crucial for successful design thinking. Students learn to articulate their ideas clearly,
            collaborate effectively in teams, and embrace diverse perspectives. These skills are in high demand across
            all industries.

        <h3>Course Projects</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Applying Theoretical Knowledge:</strong> Course projects provide a platform for
            students to apply the theoretical knowledge they gain in lectures and textbooks. This practical application
            helps them solidify their understanding and develop deeper insights.
          </li>
          <br>
          <li>
            <strong>Independent Learning and Exploration:</strong> Course projects often allow for
            independent research and exploration of specific topics. Students learn to manage their time, conduct
            research, and present their findings. These skills are crucial for lifelong learning and professional
            success.Working on real-world software projects challenges students to identify problems, design
            solutions, and implement them effectively. This fosters critical thinking and problem-solving skills
